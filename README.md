# üß† ML-LungCancerClassifier
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of CT images into three categories: `benign`, `malignant`, and `normal` cases.This aids in the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer using deep learning models.

# üèóÔ∏è Model Architectures Used:
1. Custom CNN Model
   - Built from scratch with Tensorflow/Keras.
   - Lightweight and fast.
   - Achieved 96.67% accuracy on test set.
   - ## Architectural Flow
      - 2 Convolutional Layers each with:
         - `64 filters`, `3x3` kernels
         - Followed by **ReLU activation**
         - Followed by 2x2 **MaxPooling** (downsampling feature maps)
      - Flatten: Converts 2D feature maps into 1D
      - Dense(16): Fully connected layer
      - Dense(3) with Softmax: Output for 3-class classification
      - ```
         Conv2D ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí MaxPooling √ó2
         Flatten ‚Üí Dense(16)
         Dense(3) ‚Üí Softmax
        ```
2. ResNet-based Model
   - Transfer learning using pretrained ResNet50 (ImageNet weights).
   - Fine-tuned on your dataset.
   - Achieved  95.76% accuracy on the test set.
