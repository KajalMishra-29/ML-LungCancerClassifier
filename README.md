# üß† ML-LungCancerClassifier
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of CT images into three categories: `benign`, `malignant`, and `normal` cases.This aids in the early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer using deep learning models.

# üèóÔ∏è Model Architectures Used:
1. Custom CNN Model
   - Built from scratch.
   - Lightweight and fast.
   - Achieved 96.67% accuracy on test set.
2. ResNet-based Model
   - Transfer learning using pretrained ResNet50 (ImageNet weights).
   - Fine-tuned on your dataset.
   - Achieved  95.76% accuracy on the test set.

# üìä Dataset Details:          
- Sourced from Kaggle: `IQ-OTH/NCCD Lung Cancer` Dataset          
- 3-class classification: Malignant, Benign, Normal.
