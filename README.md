# üß† ML-LungCancerClassifier
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of lung cancer images into three categories: benign cases, malignant cases, and normal cases. Assist in early and accurate detection of lung cancer using deep learning.

This project includes two model architectures:
- Custom CNN Model: Lightweight convolutional architecture built from scratch for image classification.
- ResNet-based Model: A deeper and more powerful feature extractor using ResNet50.Helps improve accuracy and generalization.

Both models are evaluated on the same dataset using:

# üìÇ Dataset
Sourced from Kaggle: `IQ-OTH/NCCD Lung Cancer` Dataset
It contains labeled CT images across the three classes.
