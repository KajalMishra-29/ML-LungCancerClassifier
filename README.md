# ML-LungCancerClassifier
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of lung cancer images into three categories: benign cases, malignant cases, and normal cases. The dataset consists of labeled images, which are processed and used to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for accurate classification.
